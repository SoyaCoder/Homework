Firemen had been fighting the forest fire for nearly 3 weeks before they could get it under control. A short time before, great trees had covered the countryside for miles around. Now, smoke still rose from the warm ground over the desolate hills. Winter was coming on the hills threatened the surrounding the villages with destruction, for heavy rain would not only wash away the soil but would cause serious floods as well. When the fire had at last been put out, the forest authorities ordered several tons of a special type of grass-seed which would grow quickly. The seed was spread in large quantities by aeroplanes .he planes had been planting seed for the nearly a month when it began to rain. By then, however, in many places the grass had already taken root. In the place of great trees which had been growing there for centuries, patches of grass had begun to apppear in the blackened soil.
