#  Lesson 54 Sticky fingers

After breakfast, I sent the children to school and then I went to the shops. It was still early when I returned home. The children were at school, my husband was at work and the house was quiet. So I decided to make some meat pies. In a short time I was busy mixing butter and flour and my hands were soon covered with sticky pastry. At exactly that moment the telephone rang. Nothing could have been more annnoying. I picked up the reciever between two sticky fingers and was dismayed when I reconized the voice of Helen Bates. It took me ten minutes to persaude her to ring back later. At last I hung up the receiver.What a mess! There was pastrey on my fingers, on the telephone, asnd the doorknobs. I had no sooner got back to the kitchen than the doorbell rang loud enough to wake the dead. This time it was the postman and he wanted me to sign for a registered letter!
