# Lesson 58 A blessing in disguise?

The tiny village of Frinley is to possess a 'cursed tree'. Because the tree was mentioned in the newspaper, the number of visitors to Frinley has increased. The tree was planted fifty years ago, but only in recent years that it has gained an evil reputation. It is said that if anyone touchs the tree, they will have bad luck; if he picks a leaf, he will die. Many villagers belive the tree has already claimed a number of victims. The vicar has been asked to cut the tree down, but so far he has refused. He has pointed out that the tree is a useful source of income, as tourists have been coming from all parts of the country to see it. In spite of all that being said, the tourists have been picking leaves and cutting their names on the tree-trunk. So far, not one of them has been struck down by sudden death
