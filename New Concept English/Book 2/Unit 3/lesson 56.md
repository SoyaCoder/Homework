After a great many of explosions, the race began. Many of the cars broke down on the course and some drivers spent more time under their cars than in them! A few cars, however, finished the race. The winning car reached a sped of fourty miles an hour. - much faster than any of its rivals. it sped downhill at the end of the race and the driver had a lot of trouble trying to stop it.
