Last Christmas, the circus owner, Jimmy Gates, decided to bring some presents to a Children's hospital. Dressed up as Father Christmas and accompanied by a 'guard of honour' of six pretty girls, he set off the main street of the city on a baby elephant named Jumbo. He should have known the police would never allow such a thing. A policeman approached Jimmy and told him he ought to gone along a side street as Jumbo was holding up the traffic. Though Jimmy agreed to move at once, Jumbo refused to move. Fifteen policeman had to push very hard to et him off the main street. The police had a very diffucult time but, they were most amused. 'Jumbo must weigh a few tons,' said a policeman afterwards, 'so it was fortunate we didn't have to carry him. Of course we should arrest him, but he has a good record, we shall let him off this time.'
