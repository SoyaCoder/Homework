# Lesson 61 Trouble with the Hubble

The Hubble telescope was launched into space by NASA on April 20, 1990 at the cost of over a billion dollars. Right from the start there was trouble with Hubble. The pictures it sent were very disappointing becuase its main mirror was faulty! NASA is now going to put the telescope right, so it will soon be sending up to four astronauts to  the Hubble. A robot-arm from the Endeavour will grab the telescope and hold it while the astronauts make the necessary repairs. Of course, the Hubble is above Earth's atmosphere, so it will soon be sending us the clearest pictures of the stars and distant galaxies that we have ever seen. The Hubble will tell us a great deal about the age and size of the universe. By the time your reading this, the Hubble's eagle eye will have sent us thousands thousands of wonderful pictures.
