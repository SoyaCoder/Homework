Jeremy Hampden has a large circle of friends and is very popular at parties. Everybody admires him for his great sense of humour-everybody. that is, except his-six-year-old, daughter Jenny. Recently, one of Jeremys closest friends asked him at a wedding reception. This is the sort of thing that Jeremy loves. He prepeared the speech carefully and went to the wedding with Jenny. He had included a large number of funny stories in the speech and, of course, it was a great success. As soon as he had finished, Jenny told him she wanted to go home. Jeremy was a little dissapointed but did as his daughter asked. On the way home, he asked Jenny if she had enjoyed the speech. To his suprise, she said she hadn't. Jeremy aked her why this was so and she told him she did not like seeing so many people laughing at him!
