# Lesson 23 A new house 

I had a letter from my sister yesterday. She lives in Nigeria. In her letter, she said she would come to England next year. If she comes she will get a big surprise. We are living in a beautiful new house min the country. Work on it has begun before she left. The house was comepleted five months ago. In my letter, I told her she could stay with us. The house has many large rooms and a lovely garden. It is a very modern house , so it looks strange to some people. It must be the only modern house in the district.
