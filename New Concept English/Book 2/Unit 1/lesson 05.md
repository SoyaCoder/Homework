# No wrong numbers

Mr.James Scott has a garage in Silbury and now he has bought another garage in Pinhurst. Pinhurst is only 5 miles from Silbury, but Mr.Scott cannot get a telephone for his new garage, so he has just bought twelve pigeons. Yesterday, a pigeon carried the first message from Pinhurst to Silbury. The bird covered the distance in three minutes. Up to now, Mr.Scott has sent a great many requests for spare parts and other urgent messages from one garage to the other. In this way, he has begun his own private 'telephone' service.
