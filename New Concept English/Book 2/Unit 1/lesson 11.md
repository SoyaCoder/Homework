# Lesson 11 One good turn deserves another

I was having dinner at a restaurant when Tony Steele came in. Tony workwed in a lawyer's office years ago, but now working at a bank. He gets a good salary, but he always borrows money from his friends and never pays it back. Tony saw me and sat at the same table. He has borrowed money from me. While he was eating I asked him to lend me twenty pounds. To my suprise, he gave me the money immediately. 'I have never borrowed any money from you,' Tony said, 'so now you can pay for my dinner'!
