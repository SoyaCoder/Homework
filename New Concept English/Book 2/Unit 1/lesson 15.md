# Lesson 15 Good news

The secretary told me that Mr. Harmsworth would see me. I felt very nervous when I went into his office. He did not look up from his desk when I entered. After I had sat down, he said business was very bad. He told me that the firm could not afford to pay such large salaries. Twenty people had already left. I knew my turn had come.

'Mr.Harmsworth,' I said in a weak voice.
'Don't interrupt,' he said.
Then he smiled and told me I would recieve an extra thousand pounds a year!
