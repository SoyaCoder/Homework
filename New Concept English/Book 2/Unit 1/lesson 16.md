# Lesson 16 A polite request

If you park your car in the wrong place, a traffic police will soon find it. You will be very lucky if he lets you go without a ticket. However, this does not always happen. Traffic police are sometime very polite. During a holiday in Sweden, I found this note on my car: ', we welcome you to our city. This is a "No Parking" area. You wil enjoy your stay here if you pay attention to our street signs. This note is only a reminder.' If you recieve a request like this, you can not fail to obey it!
