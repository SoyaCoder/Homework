# Lesson 22 A glass envolope

My daughter, Jane, never dreamed of receiving a letter from a girl her own age in Holland. Last year, we were travelling across the Channel and Jane put a piece of paper with her name and address on it into a bottle. She threw the bottle into the sea. She never thought about it again, but ten months later, she recieved a letter from a girl in Holland. Both girls now write to each other regularly now. However, they have decided to use the post office. Letters will cost a little more, but they will certainly travel faster.
