# Lesson 18 He often does this!

After I had lunch at a village pub, I looked for my bag. I had left it on a chair beside the door and now it wasn√®t there! As I was looking for it the landlord came in. 'Did you have a good meal?' he asked. 'Yes thank you,' I answered, 'but I can't pay the bill, I haven't got my bag.' The landlord smiled  and immediatly went out. In a few minutes he returned with my bag and gave it back to me. 'I'm very sorry,' he said. My dog has taken it to the garden. He often does this!
