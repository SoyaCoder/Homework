# Lesson 20 One man in a boat

Fishing is my favourite sport. I often fish for hours withought catching anything. But this does not worry me. Some fisherman are unlucky. Instead of catching fish, they catch old boots and rubbish. I am even less lucky. I never catch anything - not even old boots. After spending whole mornings on rivers, I always go home with an empty bag. 'You must give up fishing!' my friends say. 'It's a waste of time.' But they don't realize one important thing. I'm not really intrested in fishing. I am only intrested in sitting in  a boat doing nothing at all!
