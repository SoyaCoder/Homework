#  Lesson 39 Am I all right 

while John Gilbert was in hospital, he asked his doctor to tell whether his operation had been successful, but the doctor refused to do so. The following day, the patient asked for a bedside telephone. When he was alone, he telephoned the hospital exchange and asked for Doctor Millington. When the doctor answered the phone, Mr. Gilbert said he was inquiring about a certain patient, a Mr. John Gilbirt. He asked if Mr. Gilbert's operation had been successful and the doctor told him that it had been. He then asked if Mr.Gilbert would be allowed to go home and the doctor said he would need to stay in hospital for another two weeks. Then Dr. Millington asked the caller if he was a relative of the patient. 'No,' the patient answered,'I am Mr. John Gilbert.'
