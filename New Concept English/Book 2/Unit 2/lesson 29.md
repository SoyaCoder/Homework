#  Lesson 29 Taxi!
 
Captainen Fawcett has bought an unusual taxi and begun a new service. The 'taxi' is a small Swiss aeroplane called a 'Pilatus Porter'. Thsi wonderful taxi can carry up to seven passengers. The most suprising thing about it, however, is that it can land anywhere: on snow, water, or even a ploughed field. Captain Fawcett's first passenger was a doctor who flew from Birmingham to a lonely village in the Welsh mountains. Since then, Captain Fawcett has flown passengers to many unusual places. Once he landed on the roof of a block of flats and on another occasion, he landed in a abandoned car park. Captain Fawcett has just refused a strange request from a buissnessman. The man wanted to fly to Rockall, a lonely island in the Atlantic Ocean, but Captain Fawcett did not take him because the trip was too dangerous
