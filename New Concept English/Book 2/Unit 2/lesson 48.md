#  Lesson 48 Did you want to tell me something?

Dentists always ask questions when it is impossible for you to answer. My doctor has just pulled out one of my teeth and told me to rest for a while. I tried to say something but my mouth was full of cotten wool. He knew I collected matchboxes and asked me if my collection was growing. Then he asked me how my brother was and whether I liked my new job in London. In answer to these I either nodded or made strange noises. Meanwhile my tongue was busy searching out the hole where the tooth had been. I suddenly felt very worried, but could not say anything. When the doctor at last removed the cotten wool from my mouth, I was able to tell him that he had pulled out the wrong tooth.
