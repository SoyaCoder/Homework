#  Lesson 44 Through the forest

Mrs. Anne Sterling did not think of the risk she was taking when she ran through a forest after two men. They had rushed up to her while she was having a picnic at the edge of the forest with her children and tried to steal her handbag. In the struggle, the strap broke and, with the bag in their possession, both man started running through tree. Mrs. Sterling got so angry that she ran after them.  She was soon out of breath, but continued to run. When she caught up with them, she saw that they had sat down and were going through the contentsof the bag, so she ran straight at them. The men got such a fright that they dropped the bag and ran away. 'The strap needs mending,' said Mrs. Sterling later, 'but they did not steal anything.'
